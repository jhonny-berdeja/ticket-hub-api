# Waits for the infra-hub deploy run dispatched at or after
# <since-timestamp> to finish, and fails if it didn't succeed.
# `gh workflow run` (used by dispatch-infra-hub-deploy.sh) is
# fire-and-forget -- it returns as soon as GitHub accepts the
# dispatch, before the triggered workflow even starts. This script
# finds that run and blocks until it's done, so a caller never treats
# "the deploy was dispatched" as "the deploy succeeded".
#
# Retry count/interval are overridable via
# WAIT_FOR_INFRA_HUB_DEPLOY_MAX_ATTEMPTS / _SLEEP_SECONDS (defaults:
# 12 attempts, 5s apart -- up to 60s for the dispatched run to show up
# in the list) so tests don't have to sleep for real.
#
# Usage: wait-for-infra-hub-deploy.sh <repository-owner> <since-timestamp-utc>
