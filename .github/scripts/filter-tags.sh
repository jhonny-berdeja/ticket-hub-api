#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Filters a newline-delimited tag file into a "keep" or "delete" set,
# based on whether each tag matches either of two kept tags (the
# previous-stable tag and the new tag). Prints matching lines to
# stdout, one per line, in the same order as the input file.
#
# Shared by both the "tags to keep" and "tags to delete" steps in
# cleanup-image-tags.yml -- same partition, opposite side, so one
# script covers both instead of duplicating the loop.
#
# Usage: filter-tags.sh <keep|delete> <tag-file> <kept-tag-1> <kept-tag-2>
